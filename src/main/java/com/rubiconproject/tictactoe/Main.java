/**
 * Created by Yauheni Yudzitski <yauheni.yudzitski@gmail.com>
 * <p>
 * JAVA CODING TASK: Implement standard game of TicTacToe
 * - two players: X and O
 * - Players alternate in turn (as in standard TicTacToe)
 * - 3x3 board
 * - Default "Win Conditions":  3 in a row, a column or diagonally
 * <p>
 * Further Directives
 * - Simple UI:  stdout text prompt to get the (x,y) for each move from stdin.
 * Keep UI simple and dumb as possible while still
 * letting players choose their moves.
 * UI will be used primarily for demonstration/validation.
 * The UI is not the focus of this task.
 * <p>
 * - Choose a design that would allow easy addition of
 * alternate games where just the "win conditions" would change.
 * The size/shape of the board and the order of play do not change
 * with the diffferent versions of the game...  just the win
 * conditions.
 * <p>
 * - While correct code is a goal, it is not the only goal ... We are looking
 * for product level appropriate architecture, design, implementation
 * and testing that meets the spec.
 * Treat this code a component of a larger system (excluding
 * the UI).
 * <p>
 * - Be sure to communicate a coherent functional design.
 * <p>
 * Questions are good....  if you need clarification of this
 * description... better to ask than assume.
 * <p>
 * Be prepared to defend your choices and demonstrate your result.
